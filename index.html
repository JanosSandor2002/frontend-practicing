          <span class="span">This project</span> offers a combination of three
          distinct types of games, each designed to engage users in a unique and
          interactive way. First, there is the
          <span class="span">Prediction</span> section, which provides daily
          insights and forecasts about your life, allowing you to explore and
          reflect on potential outcomes in a fun and entertaining manner.
          Second, the project includes a
          <span class="span">Guessing Game</span>, where players are challenged
          to deduce a hidden word through logic, intuition, and a bit of
          creativity, testing their cognitive skills and offering a playful
          sense of achievement with each correct guess. Finally, there is a
          <span class="span">Gallery</span>, which showcases a curated
          collection of aesthetically appealing images, offering visitors a
          chance to appreciate the visual artistry and creative expression
          behind earlier works. Together, these three components create a
          dynamic and multifaceted experience, blending entertainment, mental
          challenge, and visual inspiration in a single, cohesive platform.
